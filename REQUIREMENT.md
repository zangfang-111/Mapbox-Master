# TECHNICAL TEST

We expect to receive only the github link for this test.

### TECHS

- React 18
- Typescript
- Deck.GL
- Mapbox
- Turf.Js
- Mui 5
- Jest

### Deployment

You can use Netlify or Vercel to deploy your application and include the URL deployment in your readme file.

## The goal

1. Develop a Web app with a map (mapbox), we can, using a button, upload (in the form of geojson) a plots.

2. Once the plot is displayed on the map, you will have to draw a building in the center of it.

3. We can use sliders to change the properties of the building (floor area, number of floors and height per floor).

4. On the right we will display the statistics of the building (see attached example).

## Design

You are free for the design but you can only use Mui 5 as a library, any other styling will be from scratch using CSS.

## Rules

1. Code need to be fully tested using Jest
2. No other library
3. Your app should deployed in Netlify or Vercel
4. Your app should be fully documented

Good Luck!
